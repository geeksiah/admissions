1.3 Online Assessment Integration
Refund management with approval workflow

Also add:
1. Admin must also have more control, like managing programes, levels, requirements, school logo, application color theme, school info like contacts, locations, copyright text (should hardcoded the © and the year (dynamically changes every year), etc
2. There should be waiver code management too.
3. The system should not have too much required settings, it should be easy for anyone with minimal technical know-how to set up

Provide two togglable options (only one can be active at a time): A) Payment during/after application B) Generation of vouchers (serial and PIN numbers). In the case where the serial number is what is toggled, applicant is required to purchase voucher first, and enter purchased serial number and PIN at the begining to access application which takes away the payment requirement after forms.
Admin should be able to set and manage multiple fees.
